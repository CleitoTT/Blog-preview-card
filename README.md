# Responsive recipe page

### Overview
This is a small challenge of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) that asked us to build a webpage displaying a blog card to test our HTML and CSS skills in creating a beautiful and responsive website.
### Tecnologies used
- HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the website.
- CSS: Styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the website.
### Features
- **Responsive Layout**:The website is fully responsive, able to cater to all types of devices with various screen sizes.
- **Easy to do**: Because only basic HTML and CSS concepts are used, I think it's a pretty cool website for someone entering the job market to challenge themselves with this task.
